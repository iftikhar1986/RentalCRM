Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for monorepo structure

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Authentication**: Replit's OpenID Connect integration with Passport.js
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (HTTPS PostgreSQL connection)
- **File Processing**: ExcelJS for data export functionality

### Monorepo Structure
The application follows a clear separation of concerns:
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Common TypeScript schemas and types

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Database-only authentication system
- **Credentials**: Email/password login with session management for database users only
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies, secure flags disabled for development
- **User Types**: 
  - Admin-created users (stored in users table with base64-encoded passwords)
  - Branch manager login (using branch credentials)
  - Branch staff users (individual auto-generated credentials)
  - Role-based access control (admin/manager/staff roles)
- **User Management**: Database-only authentication supporting admin-created users, branch managers, and branch staff
- **Removed**: All dummy/seeded authentication data for production readiness

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Stores user profiles (required for Replit Auth)
- **Sessions Table**: Manages authentication sessions (required for Replit Auth)
- **Leads Table**: Core business entity storing rental inquiries with fields for:
  - Contact information (name, email, phone)
  - Rental details (location, vehicle type, dates)
  - Status tracking (new, contacted, converted, declined)
  - Special requirements and notes
- **Branches Table**: Stores branch location information and manager credentials
- **Branch Users Table**: Manages multiple staff members per branch with individual credentials
- **Vehicle Management Tables**: Complete fleet management with carTypes, carMakes, carModels, and carPlates tables with proper relationships for dynamic lead creation
- **Field Configuration Table**: Stores customizable form field settings including visibility, requirement status, labels, placeholders, help text, and ordering for dynamic lead form generation

### API Design
RESTful API endpoints:
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication routes (supports predefined users, branch managers, and branch staff)
- `/api/leads` - CRUD operations for leads with filtering/pagination
- `/api/leads/stats` - Dashboard statistics
- `/api/leads/export` - Excel export functionality
- `/api/branches` - Branch management CRUD operations
- `/api/branches/:branchId/users` - Branch staff user management
- `/api/branch-users/*` - Individual branch user operations
- `/api/field-configurations` - CRUD operations for lead form field settings and requirements

### UI Components
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Reusable component library based on Shadcn/ui
- Modal-based forms for lead creation/editing with dynamic vehicle integration
- Data tables with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Dashboard with key metrics visualization
- Vehicle management system integrated with lead creation workflow

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: Users authenticate via Replit's OAuth, sessions stored in PostgreSQL
2. **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query manages API calls with caching and background updates
3. **Form Submission**: React Hook Form validates data client-side, Zod validates server-side
4. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM handles type-safe database queries
5. **Real-time Updates**: Query invalidation ensures UI stays synchronized

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **passport**: Authentication middleware
- **express-session**: Session management

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible component primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management
- **zod**: Schema validation

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **typescript**: Type safety
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite dev server for frontend with HMR
- TSX for running TypeScript backend in development
- Environment variables for database connection
- Replit-specific plugins for development experience

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized React bundle
- ESBuild compiles backend to single JavaScript file
- Static files served by Express in production
- Database migrations handled via Drizzle Kit

### Environment Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session encryption key
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS`: Allowed domains for authentication
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment flag for production optimizations

The application is designed for deployment on Replit with built-in database provisioning and authentication, but can be adapted for other platforms with minimal configuration changes.
